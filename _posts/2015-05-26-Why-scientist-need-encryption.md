Post-Snowden my concern for my online privacy has been on a slow-cooker at the back of my conscience. However, I was unsure how to proceed to get more privacy without having to resort to the [TOR project](https://www.torproject.org).  That was until I watched [Andy Chen's TED talk on why your email is not private](https://youtu.be/hbkB_jNG-zE) and heard about [Protonmail](http://protonmail.ch) which offers free online encrypted email services that is as easy to use as any other email provider. 

Still, why would a marine scientist and family dad need encrypted email? It took me some time to understand why I need it,  but in the end I see that even normal (boring) people like myself might need strong, secure encryption now and again. Here is my list of possible realistic reasons for why I need encrypted email: 

* Sending & receiving confidential information (passwords, civil records, health information etc.)
* Confidential contact with media, authorities etc. (e.g. whistleblower situation)
* Provide others with a secure way of communicating with me

A bit paranoid perhaps, but the level of government surveillance that Edwards Snowden and Wikileaks have revealed makes me a bit uneasy, and it is good to know that it is possible to have full privacy on the internet.  So now I have a secure mail set up [erik.olsen@protonmail.com](mailto:erik.olsen@protonmail.com) where you'all can reach me securly.
