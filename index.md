## About Erik 



Erik Olsen is a principal scientist at the <a href="http://www.imr.no">Institute of Marine Research, in Bergen, Norway, </a> where he has been working since 1999. Born in Sweden to Norwegian and Swedish parents who worked extensively in developing countries Erik grew up and was educated in Bergen Norway, studying at the University of Bergen where he received a BSc in biology (1995), MSc in fisheries biology (1997) and a PhD in fisheries biology in (2002). </br>

Since completing his PhD Erik has worked at the Institute of Marine Research (www.imr.no) as a scientist primarily on issues related to ecosystem-based monitoring, assessment and management. He has developed and lead the implementation of ecosystem surveys in the Barents sea jointly with the Russian scientists from PINRO, as well as transferring the concepts to developing nations like Mozambique and Sudan through surveys and development programs. </br>

Erik was deeply involved in the development and groundwork for implementing the Norwegian Integrated Management plans, first for the Barents sea, then the Norwegian sea and finally the North Sea. This groundbreaking work in implementing ecosystem-based marine spatial planning has caught worldwide attention and Erik has been an invited speaker to present the Norwegian planning efforts and its scientific foundations at both scientific and government meetings (e.g. the United Nations). </br>

From 2009-2013 Erik was elected chair of the ICES Science Committee Steering Group on Human Interactions on the Ecosystem. He has chaired several workshops on Marine Spatial Planning as well as being a reviewer and counselor on these issues. </br>

Erik is currently seconded to <a href="http://nefsc.noaa.gov"> NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center</a> in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, as  a visiting scientist, where he continues his research on developing the science base, tools and methods for ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning.  Key study areas are the use of quantitative tools like the <a href="http://www.csiro.au/organisation-structure/divisions/marine--atmospheric-research/atlantis-ecosystem-model"> Atlantis </a> ecosystem model, as well as analyzing how ecosystem-based governance varies globally. Understanding the interactions between the socio-cultural-economic system on one hand and the ecological science needed to support sound management is at the core of his current research. </br>
